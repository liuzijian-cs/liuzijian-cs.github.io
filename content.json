This project utilizes graph neural networks to abstract the sea surface into graph adjacency matrices, which are updated over time, thus overcoming geographical constraints. By transforming sea surface temperature and three-dimensional ocean temperature data into graph structures, it effectively learns and predicts complex relationships and dynamic changes within marine data. This technology has been extensively applied to real-world datasets, demonstrating its applicability and accuracy across various marine environments. 🔹[2024-04] Academic Code Annotator, an academic code interpreter based on LLAMA3.(Github 35🌟) Academic Code Annotator, a scholarly code interpreter based on LLAMA3. Upload PDF-formatted papers and Python files; the system automatically annotates the code based on the content of the paper and exports it. The Academic Code Annotator is a scholarly code interpreter based on LLAMA 3, designed to automate code annotation to facilitate quick understanding of programming code associated with academic papers. Utilizing the LLAMA 3 8B instruct model, this project supports user uploads of papers and code, enabling literature summarization and annotated code downloads, thereby significantly enhancing research efficiency and depth of code understanding. The project is deployed on Huawei Cloud and provides a public web interactive interface and supports low-power local deployment options. 🔹[2023-06] SLAM Program Design and Development Based on Raspberry Pi Car This project focused on the assembly of an Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) equipped with four sophisticated laser-based SLAM technologies, featuring the integration of ORB-SLAM3. This cutting-edge algorithm significantly improves the vehicle’s capabilities for autonomous navigation and real-time map construction. The successful implementation facilitates precise environmental mapping and dependable navigation across complex environments, highlighting the vehicle’s enhanced operational efficacy. 2023 低速无人驾驶POC算法组2023年2月加入导师项目组，主要与研究生学长交流完成毕业论文相关实验。定期参加参与“激光SLAM与IMU定位”子模块研究小组组会。 2022 “瑕”形毕露一工业界的次品清道夫项目描述：导师项目子课题，融合大数据平台，利用动态线扫相移条纹和光度立体成像形成多数据源，在保证效率的情况下满足多种不同类型、不同伤型的滚子缺陷检测。工作职责分为以下两个部分：1.完成商业计划书涉及市场分析部分的撰写、终稿排版及审查工作；2.阅读相关文献，以第一发明人完成实用新型专利一项(审查中)，该专利公开了一种多模态融合的金属工件表面缺陷检测方法，具体涉及数据增强、Yolo v5、PointNet++、Fast-CLOCs等相关算法。 2021 基于智能技术的公交车逃生窗装置及其控制系统项目描述：提出一种稳定性好、引导性强且原理简单的公交车智能窗体系统。工作职责：完成作品设计、发明的目的和基本思路等相关文稿撰写；完成实体模型搭建和电路连接。 2021 基于智能算法的布料样本自动分类系统工作职责：1. 对数据集进行数据增强；2. 应用经典图像算法，对布料进行瑕疵检测及分类。","link":"/other_profile/projects.html"}],"posts":[{"title":"Biography","text":"Hi! I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science at the School of Computer Engineering and Science, Shanghai University. I have a passion for life and a strong interest in computer science. My research focuses on time series forecasting, spatio-temporal prediction, and marine big data forecasting and prediction 😊 After a year of master’s training, I have developed a deep interest in deep learning and am progressively mastering diverse technical stacks across various fields. I keep abreast of the latest algorithms, including KAN, mamba, diffusion, and contrastive learning methods like BYOL and CLIP, as well as Transformer variants such as Flash Attention and FlowFormer. Under the guidance of Professor Lingyu Xu and with support from my lab mates, I am focusing on innovative research in spatio-temporal sequence prediction. I have completed several research projects and am currently addressing challenges related to significant inter-frame changes and error accumulation in spatio-temporal prediction. The experimental results are promising, and I am engaged in conducting additional experiments and writing the associated paper. I am profoundly passionate about artificial intelligence and aspire to make a substantial contribution to societal development through research and application in this field👍🌏.
